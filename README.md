# Prerequisite

The prerequisites for this project are to know either R or Python, and to be able to handle mainly Dataframes (native in R, or available through the Pandas library in Python). You will also need to know the basics of descriptive statistics (mean, median, variance, graphical representations, correlation tests, bivariate analysis, etc.).

# Scenario
You are a data analyst for a major bookstore chain, freshly hired a week ago! You got to know your colleagues, your new office, but above all, the high-tech coffee machine.

But back to your mission: it's time to get your hands dirty! The IT department has given you access to the sales database. It's up to you to familiarize yourself with the data and analyze it. Your manager would like you to make a presentation to "get your hands dirty".

As you learned in your research before applying, your company, "Rester livres" first developed in a large city in France, with several stores, until you decided to open an online store. Its approach to selling books online, based on recommendation algorithms, has been a great success!

# The data
You have access to this data, extracted directly from the company's database to CSV files. Here are the files at your disposal :

- sales (called "Transactions");
- the list of customers;
- the list of products.

# Competencies assessed
- Describing a dataset using descriptive statistics
- Master fundamental statistical concepts
- Cleaning a dataset

# Your missions
## Mission No. 1
Before you can get to the heart of the matter, you'll have to do some cleaning up! For example, you will have to make choices about how to deal with missing values and outliers.

## Mission No. 2
Then you will perform the data analysis. You have a lot of freedom in this area, but it is up to you to find the information that makes sense to better understand sales.

You will have to use at least :

- indicators of central tendency and dispersion;
- a concentration analysis, using a Lorenz curve and a Gini index;
- graphical representations, including at least one histogram, 
- a representation with "moustache boxes", and a time series representation (i.e. a graph with dates on the x-axis) ;
- bivariate analyses.

## Mission No. 3
Here are some additional questions your manager has asked you:

1. Is there a correlation between the gender of the customers and the categories of products purchased?

2. Is there a correlation between the age of the customers and :
- The total amount of purchases.
- Frequency of purchase (e.g. number of purchases per month).
- The size of the average basket (in number of items).
- The categories of products purchased.
